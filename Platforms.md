Platforms
---------

Anything on the integration branch should have been tested on a recent
version of each of the following platforms:

 -  Windows with cmd.exe;
 -  Mac OS X with bash;
 -  Linux with bash.

Exceptions can be made. "Testing" does not mean "fully tested and
stable"; sometimes it is only verified that the software behaves as
expected under expected circumstances.

Other platforms might work too, we just don't take effort to ensure
that. For example PowerShell on Windows works, though inconveniently.
If you want to use Bash on Windows (for example Git Bash), you'll have
to add tools like `python` to your PATH.

More platform support can be added if testers are available. Let us
know if you want to test for a new platform.
